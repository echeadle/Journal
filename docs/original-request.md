# Keep a 5 day food, energy and mood journal

 I am looking for trends throughout your day.  Patients typically will describe their mood (depressed, anxious, flat, happy, etc) and then I ask you to give it a score of 1-5 (1 being low and 5 being extreme).  I recommend making a note during the following times:

## ** Upon waking (energy and mood).**

## ** After you break your fast.**

## ** Around noon or after lunch.##

## ** After dinner**

## ** Before you go to bed.**

For food what I really would like to see is when you first eat (types of food, calories are not as important to me) and then when you stop eating for the day/evening.  

I’ve found most people just keep notes in Apple notes or will email me once they complete the journal.  Your wife has a pretty slick app she uses for calories and can make notes and comments on mood and energy levels.  You might even be able to use AI to help you with this ;).
